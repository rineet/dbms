- Enter the table name and define columns with appropriate data types
- Optionally set a primary key from the available columns

### Designing the Schema
- **Drag tables** to reposition them in the diagram
- **Connect tables** by dragging from a column in one table to a column in another table to create foreign key relationships
- **Edit table properties** by clicking on table names or column headers

### Export Options
- **Export SQL**: Click "Export SQL" to generate SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements
- **ERD (Mermaid)**: Click "ERD (Mermaid)" to get Mermaid markup for documentation
- **Download PNG**: Click "Download PNG" to export the visual diagram as an image

### Data Management
- Add sample data by clicking the "+" button in table rows
- Edit existing data by clicking on cell values
- The application automatically validates primary key uniqueness

## Technology Stack
